## What It Is

ML-powered fantasy football draft assistant. Predicts next-season PPR fantasy points per player with position-specific LightGBM models trained on 2015–2025 NFL data, benchmarks them against ADP on held-out seasons, and feeds the projections to a draft advisor.

League settings: 12-team snake, PPR, 1 QB / 2 RB / 3 WR / 1 TE / 1 FLEX / 8 bench.

## Where Things Stand

**Honest result: the model does not beat ADP, but it is close.** After finding and fixing a target-season leak in `implied_total` (see Data Integrity), the benchmark is:

Spearman vs actual season PPR, walk-forward test seasons 2021–2025, mean of 5 model seeds. "Top-150" = the 150 best by ADP among players the model projected (~22 QB / 47 RB / 60 WR / 21 TE per season). "All" = every projected player.

| Position | Top-150 model | Top-150 ADP | Last-year PPR | All players model | All players ADP |
|----------|---------------|-------------|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| QB       | 0.305         | 0.401       | 0.228         | 0.676             | 0.765           |
| RB       | 0.539         | 0.589       | 0.367         | 0.746             | 0.750           |
| WR       | 0.511         | 0.569       | 0.464         | 0.746             | 0.750           |
| TE       | 0.407         | 0.418       | 0.304         | 0.699             | 0.688           |

- The model beats the naive "last year's PPR" baseline at every position.
- Seed spread on top-150 scores is ~0.01–0.03 (TE largest); treat gaps under ~0.03 as noise. Each test season has only ~20–60 players per position.
- Blend test (rerun on the final model; see LOG.md): among draftable players (ADP top-150), ADP alone ranks as well as any model/ADP blend (QB +0.023 at 40% model weight, CI includes 0; RB/WR +0.000). Over the deeper pool the model adds a little for WR (+0.009) and TE (+0.033). A 50/50 average of the model and the ADP-derived curve has the lowest RMSE at all four positions (0.7–1.7% better than the best single source). **The blend is not implemented in the advisor yet** — a candidate Phase 2/3 item.
- Walk-forward RMSE (2021–2025, 5-seed mean): QB 84.28, RB 58.86, WR 53.48, TE 38.69. Mean per-season R²: QB 0.47, RB 0.59, WR 0.61, TE 0.60.

**Features each position's model uses** (single source of truth: `src/features/registry.py`):
- All: lagged per-game/total stats, EPA, surge, year-over-year deltas, age/draft/size, `implied_total` (team's PRIOR-season average total).
- QB: + `qb_att_share_prev` (share of the roster QBs' prior attempts).
- RB: + vacated/competing volume (`competing_rb_carries` drives it), week-1 depth-chart tier, expected fantasy points (3 cols).
- WR: + week-1 depth-chart tier, on-field share of team pass/rush plays.
- TE: + expected fantasy points, Next Gen Stats receiving metrics.

**Training data:** 4,137 rows (2015–2025). Expanding window from 2015 was best or equal for every position (recency windows lost).

## Pipeline: how to rebuild everything

Run in this order (each step's outputs feed the next; the freshness checks fail if you skip one):

```bash
python src/data/scraper.py                       # raw nflverse files (+ roster_2026, + advanced sources)
python src/data/pipeline.py                      # clean, features, validation  -> training_data / prediction_data
python src/models/train.py                       # OPTIONAL: Optuna re-tune (writes models/*_params)
python src/evaluation/oos_predictions.py         # walk-forward predictions, 5 seeds -> season_<year>.parquet
python src/evaluation/benchmark.py               # model vs ADP vs last-year -> benchmark_v1.csv
python src/models/predict.py                     # 2026 projections -> *_predictions.parquet (close the CSVs in Excel first)
python src/draft/vor.py                          # advisor table -> predictions_table.parquet (adds ADP fallback rows)
python src/data/adp_scraper.py                   # only to refresh historical ADP (Wayback Machine, cached in data/raw/adp_html)
```

Tests: `pytest -q` (114 tests; the data-integrity tests skip when `data/` is absent). A git pre-commit hook (`.githooks/pre-commit`, enabled with `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`) runs them before every commit.

`data/raw`, `data/processed`, `data/external` are gitignored. `models/*_params` (tuned hyperparameters) **are tracked**.

---

## Data Integrity (read before changing the pipeline)

Silent data bugs were the main source of wrong results. Guardrails now in place:

- `src/data/validate.py` runs inside `pipeline.py`, `predict.py` and `vor.py`: errors stop the run (null/duplicate keys, unknown team codes, a season losing rows in a merge, out-of-range values, prediction rows that differ from training rows or carry last season's age, duplicate players in the advisor table); soft problems warn.
- `src/features/manifest.py` must classify every training column as `prior_season` or `preseason_known`; an undeclared column fails `tests/test_data_integrity.py`.
- `tests/test_data_integrity.py` recomputes lagged features from raw files and fails if a column matches the target season; also checks train/serve parity, per-position feature isolation, ADP coverage, OOS files, pinned packages, and that the advisor's `RMSE` constants in `vor.py` match the current walk-forward error (within 5%).
- `data/processed/run_manifest.json` logs commit, timestamp, row counts and params checksums per run; stale outputs raise or warn.
- Benchmark standard: per-position only (no pooled "ALL" row — ADP prices positional scarcity), 5-seed mean with spread, always next to the last-year-PPR baseline.

**Bugs found and fixed this phase** (so they are not reintroduced):
1. `implied_total` used the target season's own average closing line (leak). Now the team's prior-season total, in training and prediction. QB top-150 fell 0.61 -> ~0.21 before later fixes; the earlier "QB beats ADP" was an artifact.
2. Legacy team codes (OAK, SD, ARZ...) silently dropped ~80 rows from 2015 (and so ~90 from 2016); `schedule` loading started at 2015. Fixed via `TEAM_MAP` and loading 2014 schedules.
3. Junk "Team" rows (null `player_id`, `games` 256–272) corrupted target share for 12 team-seasons. Dropped at load.
4. Prediction rows carried 2025 age/experience/team/total for a 2026 prediction. Now advanced to the prediction season.
5. LightGBM predicts positionally: prediction columns are aligned to training columns by name in `predict.py`.
6. `vor.py` read its own previous output, matched ADP players on name only (Harrison Jr. and Pittman appeared 8 times each, shifting the WR replacement baseline), and overwrote `predict.py`'s outputs. Fixed; debugging copies are now `*_with_adp`.

## Rookies and unmodeled players

Decision: **no rookie model** in this project (a pick/age/size model cannot beat ADP; a real one needs college data and is a separate later side project). Anyone the model cannot score gets an ADP-derived projection (`src/draft/market_fallback.py`): an isotonic curve per position from rank-within-position (by ADP) to expected PPR, fit on 2021–2025. `vor.py` adds those rows to `predictions_table` flagged `market_estimate=True`; players with no GSIS ID get synthetic `market:<name>` IDs. Leave-one-season-out RMSE on the top-150: RB ~63, WR ~67, TE ~62 (QB/TE samples are tiny). Caveats: deep ranks are biased upward (curve fit on players with >=4 games); curve is fit on FantasyPros ADP but applied to Underdog ADP (rank-within-position input mitigates the pricing difference).

## What Was Tested and Did NOT Help (don't re-run without a new idea)

All tested with the standing protocol: 10-seed ablation + random-noise control, drop anything within noise.

- Re-tuning params (100–400 Optuna trials): the TE and (first) QB re-tunes were adopted; RB, WR and the second QB re-tune (after `qb_att_share_prev`) never beat the existing params. More tuning is mostly fitting noise (500–1,600 rows per position).
- WR: vacated/competing targets, QB change/quality (first-round rookie override), draft-capital x youth, two-year-history idea (declined on reasoning).
- Team pass rate/pace/points per game, team EPA/success rate, depth ranks within team, team-change flag, `seasons_since_last`.
- QB: per-game PPR features, per-game target, smaller feature set, simpler/ridge models, depth-chart tier (improves starter-vs-backup AUC and RMSE but hurts ranking among actual starters; **declined**).
- RB depth-chart competition (carry share, expected lead, proven/rookie competitor): null once vacated features are in.
- Offensive line: continuity (returning starters, snap continuity, incoming starters), prior-season adjusted line yards / sack rate, and interactions — all null, and even the line's actual same-season ALY/ASR as an oracle moved RB top-150 by only +0.006 (QB +0.017). Don't build an OL rating for model gains.

## Open / Deferred

- **Coaching tendencies** (head-coach pass-over-expected, pace, 4th-down aggression; coach's prior-team tendency when the HC changes): deliberately deferred by the user — "requires more nuance before touching". Only head coaches are in public data (schedules).
- **PFR advanced stats** skipped (only 2018+, would halve usable training rows). Participation `route` field is mostly empty, so route participation is approximated by on-field share.
- **ESPN pass/run block win rates** (best public OL measure) are not collected: ESPN/Disney terms of use prohibit scraping and compiling datasets, and there is no download/API. Investigation closed.
- **Half-PPR / standard targets** not built (Phase 3 item).
- Roadmap Phase 3 "team-context features" were largely done and tested in Phase 1 (see lists above); only features that survived are in the model. Phase 3 still needs: 2026 data retrain after the season ends, grading 2026 projections, half/standard targets.
- Model-vs-ADP gaps remain QB −0.10, RB −0.05, WR −0.06, TE −0.01 (top-150). Remaining gap is likely information the data lacks (camp news, injuries, depth-chart changes). Untested ideas are in the memory file `project_feature_ideas.md`.

## Hand-off for Phase 2 (C# core and simulator)

**The projection file does not exist yet.** `.claude/projection_schema_v1.md` defines `projections_<year>_v<N>.parquet` (+ CSV mirror), but no exporter has been written. The closest artifact is `data/processed/predictions_table.parquet` (advisor table), which has: `player_name, player_id, games, games_delta, injury_flag, projected_ppr, position, underdog, market_estimate, vor, ceiling, floor, availability_flag, vor_rank, value_gap, tier`. Missing vs the schema: `team`, `position_rmse` (values live in `RMSE` in `vor.py`), `projected_half`/`projected_standard`, `underdog_adp` naming, `schema_version`. Writing this exporter (and validating it with `validate.py`) is the first Python task Phase 2 depends on.

Things the simulator will need from Python:
- Season files for backtests: `data/processed/season_<year>.parquet` (2021–2025; `player_id, player_name, position, season, actual_ppr, oos_pred_ppr`, plus per-seed `oos_pred_s0..s4`) and `data/external/adp_<year>.csv` (FantasyPros consensus ADP from Wayback snapshots closest to the day before the opener, 2021–2025). Join on `player_id`. Rookies/unmodeled players are absent from the season files by design (unscoreable).
- The advisor logic still lives in Python (`src/draft/`: recommender, roster, draft_state, advisor, vor); per the roadmap it gets ported to `DraftBot.Core`. `REPLACEMENT_RANK` in `vor.py` is hard-coded for 12 teams and should become league-settings-driven in C#.
- 2026 ADP source is a manual Underdog CSV via 4for4 (`data/external/4for4-adp-table.csv`); historical ADP is FantasyPros, so the two differ in how they price positions.

**Housekeeping:**
- `main` is merged locally but **not pushed** to `origin` (`Angel-Cal/Draft-Advisor`); push when ready. The `Model_v2`, `Model_v3`, `draft_logic` and `phase-1-evaluation` branches are all fully merged and can be deleted.
- `src/app/cli.py`, `src/draft/vbd.py`, `src/draft/simulator.py` were moved to `archive/` in Phase 0.
- `README.md` documents the pipeline steps and the guardrails.
